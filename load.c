/*
 *  Load a program into the current process's address space.  The
 *  program comes from the Unix file identified by "name", and its
 *  arguments come from the array at "args", which is in standard
 *  argv format.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      0 on success
 *     -1 on any error for which the current process is still runnable
 *     -2 on any error for which the current process is no longer runnable
 *
 *  This function, after a series of initial checks, deletes the
 *  contents of Region 0, thus making the current process no longer
 *  runnable.  Before this point, it is possible to return ERROR
 *  to an Exec() call that has called LoadProgram, and this function
 *  returns -1 for errors up to this point.  After this point, the
 *  contents of Region 0 no longer exist, so the calling user process
 *  is no longer runnable, and this function returns -2 for errors
 *  in this case.
